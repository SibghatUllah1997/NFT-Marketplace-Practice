# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
NPX HARDHAT HELP
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test - changed by Muhammad Ali
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat test // this is gonna be fast.
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
